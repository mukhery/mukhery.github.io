It's been quite a while since my last post... I've been preoccupied with work, life, and trying to get the car up and running. To keep things brief for now, the car is driving nicely. I'm still being gentle with it, primarily because the engine is on its first couple hundred miles. I've also had the car break down a couple times now, so I'm slowly rebuilding my confidence that the car can handle long distances. I'm planning to start posting more frequently now that I've finished a few work projects and got the car up and running. I'll pick up where I left off with the engine build and then later go into some of the issues that I encountered after first start and how I've solved them. Stay tuned!
