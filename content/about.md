This is a site that I will be using to document my technical projects. I have a background in computer engineering and enjoy complex problems involving both software and hardware components. I recently purchased a replacement engine for my car and intend to rebuild the engine myself as well as investigate tuning the engine myself. As I go along, I'll try to post as much information as possible, including source code, in the hopes that some of this information will be useful to other people. Also, if you have any advice or possible solutions to some of the problems that you see me working through, please let me know!
